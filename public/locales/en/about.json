For those who know me, I've been studying and working in the field of Information Technology for over a decade.\n\nMy idea here is to share what I’ve learned during this journey and connect it with the world we live in today. Most importantly, I have no intention of making a single cent from the content I share here.\n\nThe internet is a vast — and forever FREE — space full of possibilities. I want this place to reflect that: where technology and freedom meet to turn ideas into reality."

      "content": "The idea is to keep this space alive with content, reflections, and projects that help people understand — in an accessible and non-commercial way — what’s behind the digital transformations shaping our lives.\n\nMany people worry about how fast technology is evolving, but few actually understand it — and even fewer know how to make it work for them.\n\nHere, I want to build bridges between the digital world and everyday life. To show that yes, it’s possible to embrace technology, use it consciously, and make it a true ally — now and in the future we’re shaping together."
